# ECE243FinalProject
Created a grapher, along with my lab partner, programmed using C, on the DE1SOC board.
This program takes input using a PS2 keyboard and displays it on a monitor, via VGA.
It also displays a confirmation sound upon plotting the graph.
We coded a number of functions which can also be added together or subtracted to form compound functions.
